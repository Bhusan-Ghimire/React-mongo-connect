1.   Form created, form data to form object using useState

2.send form data to server using POST fetch

3.in server 
.receive the data in post method, set the data in database and send the recent 'document' to client(react) from database

4.in react 
.receive the POST response, process it and display the username along with some other text inside <p> tag.










react --(curd request) --> express server --(curd operations perform on database)--> express server send data/message to react  



to use react website and express backed with same express server:
    use npm run build to convert whole react frontend into static files (index.html is the main file and js;css static files are in their respective folder created by build)
    host the index.html file in express by using server.use(express.static(--build foler containing the index.html file)) 
if any react related request (like going to /about route) comes from client, the request goes to express server then the express returns the index.html file (which is the main built react app) and,
this index.html handles the react related request/response.















new thing learned : 
    1. useState is async function
    2. e.target returns the corresponding DOM element
    3. react build creates static files in which index.html represents the whole website
